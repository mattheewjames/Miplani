                        <h6 class="text-black">Should you purchase the paid version of MIPLANiAPP, or opt for the free version that allows you to enjoy all the features of the software, but limits you to simulations for amounts of annual invoicing not exceeding € 30,000?</h6>
                        <p class="text-black">The answer to that question should really be based on your specific situation.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">Certainly, the free version of the application is tempting since it is cheaper.</p>
                       <h6 class="text-black">But will that really help you succeed?</h6>
                        <p class="text-black"> Instead, we recommend that you ask yourself the following two questions to determine if the free version of MIPLANiAPP is right for you.</p>
                        <h6 class="text-black">1) What do you want to achieve with your business?</h6>
                        <p class="text-black">When evaluating your software options, always keep your ultimate goal in mind. Think carefully about whether the software solution you are considering is really designed for what you need to achieve. </p>
                       <p class="text-black">MIPLANiAPP for example, is designed to help entrepreneurs achieve two main objectives:</p>
                        <ul class="list-style">
                            <li><strong>Generation of financial objectives of up to 100 million euros:</strong> MIPLANiAPP helps you determine the steps to reach any financial objective you want in the time you specify.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximizing profits:</strong> MIPLANiAPP allows you to visualize different scenarios to see what would happen if:
                            - you increase your conversion rate
                            - reduce your costs -
                            sell more items to your current customers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6 class="text-black">2) How serious are you about your business?</h6>
                        <p class="text-black">Are you really committed to hitting big numbers with your business? Do you want to build a five or six figure business? Is that your dream?</p>
                        <p class="text-black">Or is it just an idea that pops into your head from time to time?</p>
                        <p class="text-black">These answers will probably give you a better idea of whether to switch to the paid version of MIPLANiAPP, or to stick with the free version.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">Serious entrepreneurs should invest in professional tools - this is true whether they buy heavy equipment, delivery vehicles, or commercial software.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">But perhaps you are still not sure of becoming an entrepreneur or do not have a business idea. You may be curious about what a financial simulation looks like at this stage.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">In that case, the free version of MIPLANiAPP would be a good first step.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">Above all, know that you do not need an MBA to perform a financial simulation with MIPLANiAPP. Even if you are starting out for the first time, you only need to invest about 10 minutes to do it.</p>
                        <h6 class="text-black">At this point, we will say it all comes down to results</h6>
                        <p class="text-black">The free version of MIPLANiAPP can be of great help in some situations. However, it is not the best option if you are a serious and growth-focused entrepreneur.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">Ultimately, the most important thing is that the version of MIPLANiAPP you choose gives you the result you want.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">We are here to help you become a more successful entrepreneur.</p>
                        <p class="text-black">In conclusion, know that if you want to achieve a high financial goal, consider investing in the paid version of MIPLANiAPP, as you get a step-by-step roadmap to follow that helps you make informed decisions without the risk of failure.</p>
                        <p class="text-black"><span class="fw-600">Relevant</span> remark : <i>Our earnings simulation web app, MIPLANiAPP, comes with a free version that allows you to test all the features of the app, before moving on to the paid version if you are satisfied with our product.
