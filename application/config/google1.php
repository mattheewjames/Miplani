/**
 * PayPal_Lib Controller Class (Paypal IPN Class)
 *
 * This CI library is based on the Paypal PHP class by Micah Carrick
 * See www.micahcarrick.com for the most recent version of this class
 * along with any applicable sample files and other documentaion.
 *
 * This file provides a neat and simple method to interface with paypal and
 * The paypal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) interface.  This file is
 * NOT intended to make the paypal integration "plug 'n' play". It still
 * requires the developer (that should be you) to understand the paypal
 * process and know the variables you want/need to pass to paypal to
 * achieve what you want.  
 *
 * This class handles the submission of an order to paypal as well as the
 * processing an Instant Payment Notification.
 * This class enables you to mark points and calculate the time difference
 * between them.  Memory consumption can also be displayed.
 *
 * The class requires the use of the PayPal_Lib config file.
